## Sentry VS Terran 
Sentries can make a huge difference in PvT. 
Force Field can be used to block Terrans moving in to try to target key units such as Colossus. 
This is vital to ensure that the primary damage dealers of the Protoss army survive. 
Another important ability is Guardian Shield.
Since Guardian Shield reduces the damage of each incoming shot by 2, units that attack quickly such as Marines are heavily affected by the ability. 
The Sentry can be used to block off the ramp from early rushes.
