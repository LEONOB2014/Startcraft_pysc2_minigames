# Startcraft Pysc2 Deepmind minigames creation
This repository aims to serve as a guide for opensource contributing in minigame pysc2 library for Starcraft
For minigame instalation for execution you should go to https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2 and install requirements

## Minigame task description
Minigames come as a controled environments that might be useful to exploit game features in SC2. General purpose learning system for Startcraft 2 can be a daunting task. So there is a logical option in splitting this tasks into minitask in orther to advance in research . 
To investigate elements of the game in isolation, and to provide further fine-grained steps towards playing the full game, Deepmind has  built several mini-games. These are focused scenarios on small maps that have been constructed with the purpose of testing a subset of actions and/or game mechanics with a clear reward structure. Unlike the full game where the reward is just win/lose/tie, the reward structure for mini-games can reward particular behaviours (as defined in a corresponding .SC2Map file).

## Minigame introduction and Repo information
Before creating a minigame, I encourage you to run the alredy developed ones to see wich task are subdivided into each minigame as the design could be important . The minigame title gives us a description of the goal 
You might find in this repo new maps created for investigate in explotation-exploration dilema and some programming about the functions of different units .
